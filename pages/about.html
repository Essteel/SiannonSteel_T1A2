                <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        I moved to Adelaide this year and decided to make a career change into software development. Previously I studied environmental sciences at the University of Leeds in the UK, after which I worked as an Ecologist. I also have a background in administration within the higher education and healthcare industries. Working within these areas has developed a strong foundation in data analysis, technical report writing and project management. To see a full summary of my previous work experience, take a look at my resume.

                <h2>Career aspirations</h2>
                    <p>
                        I chose to re-skill and undertake a diploma in web development as I desired a career in which I could be more creative. Design and technology have always interested me and having dabbled with code during my degree, I wanted to learn more about the different roles in which programming was used.                 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I experimented with creating basic game elements in Unity and undertook some courses online to improve my understanding. Learning about the great variety of ways in which programming can be utilised is what inspired me to go back into education. I hope to do an internship at the end of my course in February to gain some real world experience.

                <h2>Hobbies and interests</h2>
                    <p>
                        I love being in nature and spend a lot of my time hiking and walking. I also like to try new things and learned how to scuba dive and rock climb at university, eventually progressing to teach scuba diving with my local club. In my downtime I like nothing more than curling up under a blanket and exploring virtual worlds through video games.
