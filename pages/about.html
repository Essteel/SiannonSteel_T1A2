                    <p>
                        Previously I worked as an Ecologist in the UK, and also have a background in administration within the higher education and healthcare industries. Upon moving to Adelaide this year I decided to make a career change into software development. To see a full summary of my previous work experience, take a look at my resume.

                <h2>Career aspirations</h2>
                    <p>
                        I chose to re-skill and undertake a diploma in web development as I desired a career in which I could be more creative. Design and technology have always interested me and having dabbled with code during my degree, I wanted to learn more about the different roles in which programming was used. I experimented with creating basic game elements in Unity and began to try out some courses online to improve my understanding. Learning about the great variety of ways in which programming can be utilised inspired me to go back into education. I hope to do an internship at the end of my course in February to gain some real world experience.
