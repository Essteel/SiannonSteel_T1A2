## Purpose & target audience

The purpose of the website is to demonstrate my new skills as a trainee web developer to prospective employers and colleagues. The site aims to demonstrate a core understanding of HTML, CSS and Flexbox as well as expressing some of my personality.

## Sitemap

The website is laid out in three levels, beginning with the homepage (index.html). This is linked to three child pages: About, Projects and Blog. The Blog page also has five child pages in the form of blog articles. After creating the sitemap I planned each page within Figma, creating a wireframe for three different screen sizes for each page.

## Functionality and features

All pages feature a navigation bar at the top with a clickable logo in the top left to return them to the home page, as well as the menu options for each page. The menu options are placed in the order I would like the user to visit them. All pages also feature a footer with links to GitHub and LinkedIn, as well as a copyright logo. I used media breakpoints to ensure each page looked how I wanted it to on phone, tablet and desktop size screens.

The logo and social media icons are responsive, highlighting with a gold border when hovered over or clicked. The menu options also increase in size to show when they have been hovered over or clicked. Buttons and links are indicated by a purple font and become underlined when hovered over to show that they are links. The button background also highlights in gold when hovered over.

### **Homepage**

The homepage is the landing page for the site and also acts as a contact page. Links within the text encourage the user to visit the 'about' page. The image fades in upon loading, drawing the users eye to the information below.

### **About page**

The about page describes my career and educational background, my aspirations as well as some personal information about my hobbies and interests. The content is ordered by which content I think the user will be most interested in and includes a link to my resume, as well as a link back to the contact details on the homepage with a call to action to 'get in touch'.

### **Projects page**

This page features three placeholder blocks for projects that I have completed with an image, title and brief description. Once I have completed projects suitable for my portfolio in the future, I will create a child page for each project and the respective block will act as a link to them.

### **Blog homepage**

Similar to the projects page, this contains blocks for five blog articles with clickable images and titles which link to the relevant child page. Each block also has a brief description of the article to help the user decide if they would like to read it.

### **Blog articles**

Each blog article features the date it was published, a large image capturing the theme of the article, an image caption, the article text and a link back to the blog homepage.
